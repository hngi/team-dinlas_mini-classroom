# Team Dinlas Mini Classroom Web App

## Overview

## Contributing

We're working with four branches

- `master`
- `develop`
- `frontend`
- `backend`

Our `master` branch is solely for deployment and should be touched!

Create a new Pull Request (PR) to the particular track your working on. e.g you're working on frontend cod, you create a Pull Request to `frontend`.
If you're working on backend, you create a Pull Request to the `backend` branch.

We'll bring FE and BE code to `develop` and when we're ready to test.
Only when we're god to go, that's when we merge with `develop` with `master` branch and deploy.

NOTE: Please always include details of what you worked on in your commit and Pull Request messages, with possible screenshots.
Also remember to `pull` first to update your local repo before working and making a PR.
