Hi, Guys... 

So this A simple registration and login for gaining access to the tutors dashboard

To test this,

1. Ensure you have Xampp Installed on your machine or Wamp.

2. There is an Sql folder that has two different "SQL FILE TYPE" you can import directly to your phpmyadmin 
by using the file (import.php) with the .php extension or create a db with the name classroom 
and import the file (import.sql) with the .sql extension to create a table in the db(classroom) with all the required columns.

3.  I am Still Making improvements on the registration... It will get better

4. Please, if you notice any bugs, do let me know.
